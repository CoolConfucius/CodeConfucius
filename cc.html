        <h4>Single Player Blackjack 21 against AI in jQuery</h4>
        <p>User plays against an AI with a standard deck of 52 cards. Face cards count as ten points. Player and AI can count an ace as 1 point or 11 points. Other cards are counted as their numeric value. Both players begin with two cards. User can choose to “hit”, add a card to their hand, or “stand”, take no cards. The player whose hand exceeds 21 is busted. When neither busts, the player with higher points win. </p>

        <h4>Single Player Battleship against AI in jQuery</h4>
        <p>Two 10x10 grids. User places 5 ships of lengths—2, 3, 3, 4, 5 squares—onto their grid. May place the ships horizontally or vertically. On the other grid, the AI has 5 ships of the same lengths placed randomly. All ships must be within their grids and not overlap. AI’s ships are hidden from the user.  User and AI take turns hitting a square on each other’s grid. When a ship is hit, the square is marked as hit. Else, the square is marked as miss. The player who sinks all their opponent’s ships wins.</p>
